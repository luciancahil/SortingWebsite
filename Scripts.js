var SelectionExplanation = "<p>Selection sort works by iterating through each element, and swaping the smallest element with the first element that isn't yet sorted.</p>"
var QuickExplanation = "<p>Quick sort works by choosing the middle element, and then dividing each element into 2 groups: one larger than the chosen element, and one smaller. Repeat for each subgroup until each subgroup is only one elment large, and we have a sorted list</p>"
var BubbleExplanation = "<p>Bubble sort works by setting the first element as the main element and comparing it to the next. If the element is larger than the next, switch. Otherwise, set the next element as the main elment. Repeat until the main elment is at the end of the list (the largest is now the larges). Repeat for each element</p>";
var InsertionExplation = "<p>Insertion sort works by taking an already sorted array at the start (An array of One is sorted), and swapping the next element with the next largest sorted element until the next element is in the proper order. Repeat for each element</p>"
var MergeExplanation = "<p>Merge sort works by breaking each half of the list into a sorted array. We then add the smallest element from each subarray into a new array, repeating until both subarrays are exhausted. We then copy each element in order from the new array to the old array.</p>";
var HeapExplanation = "<p>Heap sort works by converting the list into a maximum heap. We then swap the first (largest) element with the last, remove the last element from the heap into the next spot of the sorted array, and then sink the new first element of the heap until we have a valid heap again. Repeat until the heap is empty.</p>";
